 * 
 * It begins with a passenger, and when the booking is commenced by the region 
 * responsible for it, an available driver is allocated from dispatch. If no driver is 
 * available, the booking must wait until one is. When the passenger arrives at the destination,
 * a BookingResult object is provided with the overall information for the booking.
 * 
 * The Booking must track how long it takes, from the instant it is created, to when the 
 * passenger arrives at their destination. This should be done using Date class' getTime().
 * 
 * Booking's should have a globally unique, sequential ID, allocated on their creation. 
 * This should be multi-thread friendly, allowing bookings to be created from different threads.
